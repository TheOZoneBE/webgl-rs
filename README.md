# webgl-rs
This crate aims to provide a safe and Rusty interface to the WebGL API.

## Documentation
Docs.rs is currently not able to build documentation for this crate because of the use of the nightly toolchain. So currently documentation resides [here](https://theodedeken.github.io/webgl-rs/).

## Disclaimer
This crate is still very much in development. Currently only WebGL2 is implemented and not all methods are 100% safe.
